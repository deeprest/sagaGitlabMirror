*Establish the design before resuming work*

DEATH options:
1. Respawn
2. Parts. reclaim parts
3. Gears. Health can be reclaimed from dropped "gears" ala Sonic. Respawn if empty.
4. Instant Replay. Go back before death and replay with a few seconds leeway.
- Instant Replay: Playback system, use for death cycle:  go back in time to last grace period, play a couple seconds, and have a countdown, then let the player resume where they were at that point. If they die within 3 seconds, rewind even further to grace period before that.
5. Tiny

+ liftbot
remove trigger layer, add OnTriggerEnter, collider->trigger = true
removed layers: flameprojectile, enemy

Use abilities gained from defeating enemies in the stage to defeat the boss. Can only use one ability per each MOUNT point. Abilities persist as long as they are installed. Replacing an ability drops it on the ground.
Weapons are acquired from bosses. You can switch to them anytime.

Bosses.  Big wrecking ball robot. Agile melee ninja.

- confirm that Teams are set for all characters.
- remove global references to CurrentPlayer where possible
- cursorOuter is different based on control device
- Character agentType: remove need for Global.instance.AgentType lookup. Just use ints.
- trigger release shoots graphook
- mech punch should break boxes

### Composite Sprite Problems
+ composite sprite render layers. Create a layer for each composite, or how to keep entire composites from interlacing with one another? SOLUTION: Animate a *struct* int for each piece, and update the sortingOrder of the SpriteRenderers from LateUpdate().

- pixel-perfect animations must be done in Unity for each piece. Snap to pixel density, use constant anim curves.
- 2d skeleton rigs, avatars, and IK can not be used with composites. Skeletons use rotations, and these anims are not rotation-based.


### Janky
- landing snaps. possible anim frame adjustment will fix
- adjust jump anim frame. it pops at the jump arc apex
- high offset off angled floor
- FIX long slide clipping. collision should reduce velocity, not only position.
+ mushy on lift. consider the velocity of the object being collided-with. [CarryObject]

### Menu / UI
+ buttons accept mouse clicks
- design a better menu

### Input
- better display names
- bindings: read/write

### Straight Up Bugs
+ wheelbots are buggy
- airbot attack, use attack speed until at last known target position
- fix grap when using gamepad (double)
- fix grap going through boxes
- fix stickybomb going through vents

### Easy / Cosmetic
- city camera bounds
- DrCain minimum speech threshold
- light reflects too much on background layer 1 with buster
- door sprite layer should be behind characters
- control name text for right stick says "RS"
- door should indicate when it refuses to open because of team affiliation.

### Hornet
- hornet friendly fire
hornet avoid friendlies
hornet proximity raycast
hornet particles should not rotate, and should disappear

### Minimap
- minimap. Needs shader/coloring. Should follow player position, not camera
- minimap render static once. render only characters on second render texture

### New Stuff
- hide arm while not shooting
- align shot with surface when aiming into floor/wall
+ draw an aiming line

### Unity Bugs
- UNITY bug: [MACOS] cursor movement in last direction when shoot
- UNITY bug: [WEBGL] webgl audio loop

### Linux Issues
- mouse sensitivity is too high even on lowest setting (0.05)
- scroll wheel sensitivity is too low
- support Ctrl-Q to quit
- no per-pixel lights (check OpenGL/Vulcan support)
- control names are not converted in diagetics (but okay in menu)
+ glitchy/wrong sprite shader for mech on linux. [SOLVED. This is because of texture compression settings on each individual texture.]
