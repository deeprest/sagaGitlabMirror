## Mega Man X Breakdown
*Demonstrates enemy abilities in a safe, controlled environment first.*
Intro level teaches everything you need to know:
* run and jump. basic movement. implicit goal of progression
* take damage. vulnerability
* death cycle
* shoot. a way to overcome vulnerability
* kill enemies. defeat obstacles to progress
* rewards, minibosses
* enemy sweet spots
* arrange for wallslide to teach walljump out of pit
* Vile: you cannot win, saved by zero (demos charge shot and dash)
* Theme: grow stronger / self improvement

    ### Opinion
    Megaman X1-X3 suffers from the same problems: small viewing area, can only shoot forward, enemies respawn immediately out of sight, levels are static.
    Megaman X4 is so bad that I never played another MMX game again. I've watched gameplay videos to keep up to date with the MMX games, but it seems the series never improved.


MMX 4:3 screen ratio
Chamber = 10.5 player widths X 6.5 player heights

16:10 screen ratio
Chamber = 12.5 player widths X 6.5 player heights
