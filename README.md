# Saga 2020
A game prototype. This is mostly a Mega Man X gameplay clone with many improvements. Made in Unity.

## Major changes to the Mega Man X formula
1. Player can aim instead of only shooting forward.
1. Arbitrary ground and wall angles
1. No instant-death spikes or bottomless pits.
1. Enemies respawn at visible and known locations, not invisible static points.
1. Replace teleportation with airdrop from chopper.
1. Projectiles collide with walls.
1. Avoid button-mashing with hold-to-fire. This is to save wear-and-tear on game controller triggers, and mouse buttons.
