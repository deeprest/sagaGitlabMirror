Badasses. Bad asses. Smart asses. Hard asses. Soft asses. Big asses. Are hard asses good asses? Are soft asses bad asses?
* Rated N for Nobody
* full screen texture flash to supplement explosions. use with small screen shake.
* A little robot that gets excited and follows you around (jeans badger)
* A couple of idle idiots speculating on why the robots are now evil.
* A miniboss inspired by the **relentless** posturing that evil enemies (in movies) do, which buys the good guys enough time to defeat them. A big guy that never stops taunting and cannot be damaged, but has a single weakness that is revealed at some point. Since this game has no death, maybe he's only vulnerable to the spiderbot form.
* "we're running dangerously low on stickers!"
* "My only regret..."
  * is not eating more [snausages]
  * is upgrading my wireless data plan
  * is not buying that timeshare in Florida
  * is not robbing that waffle house
* STUPID/LAZY/CRAZY. The game starts out with positive encouragement, and increasingly gets negative until it's throwing negative gremlin thoughts at you.
  * "you'll do fine!" ("pfft" says a bystander)
  * "I'm sure you'll be the greatest hero we've ever seen"
  * "You're not that bad."
  * "I've seen worse."
  * Too bad you blew up the supplies...
  * Not the most graceful hero I've seen.
  * The real heroes must have been busy saving someone else.
  * Eventually:
  * "why do you even bother"
  * you're never going to finish.
  * you're a loser. just admit it.
  * Why try so hard? You're going to quit this just like everything else you start.

## GDC Hitchhiker's Guide to Rapid prototypes
Minimum Viable product.
### SMART goals
1. Specific: precise description of what is to be accomplished.
2. Measurable: progress is visible and tracked.
3. Attainable: what actions are needed to make it happen.
4. Relevant: meaningful and realistic.
5. Time-Bound: estimated time for completion.
### Strategy
Carefully designed plan of action. Accounts for:
* Deliverables
* Features
* Functions
* Tasks
* Deadlines
* Costs
**Effectively Scoped**
### Scope
Recognize Barriers.
Bad scope can come from your Ego.
Humility can help feel out your internal barriers:
* Attitude
* Emotions
* Understanding
* Creativity
* Skill
Humility will spot external barriers:
* Time
* Resources
* Location
* Opportunity
* Competition
"Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can." - Arthur Ashe
### Vision
Two parts: Game Concept and Design. Focus more on the design iteration.
Core Mechanic. Secondary Mechanics. progression. Narrative.


## Design Advice (from unknown youtube video)
Must: Onboard player with forced-learning mechanics.
Must: Polish lots.
Avoid: Starting Too BIG.
Avoid: Idea commitment.
Avoid: Story up front.
Avoid: Overly rigid design.
Avoid: Arbitrarily adding things.
### From GDU, design mistakes
* (experiment) prototype first instead of design-up-front
* (vision) do not follow trends
* (escapism) avoid making decisions based on what's realistic
* (ease of use) UI / UX, onboarding
* inconsistent design.. (recognizable patterns)
* not having a clear vision or mantra
* ignoring feedback
* not valuing feedback


## misc thoughts
The pivot model
Flow: challenge vs ability
tension and relief
exploration: secret areas. beacons. minimap.

efficiency: time and energy
energy investment towards an expected outcome
path of least resistance VS challenge
everything out of necessity
means-end chain

games are emotionally powerful:
lure you to play
mechanics: establish a structure / limits
give you a goal
mechanics: give you abilities to reach that goal
provide obstacles to challenge your progress
overcoming the challenge is one source of enjoyment; not too hard or too easy.



# Spiderbot (defunct)
start as spiderbot (maybe nothing notices you when you're a spiderbot)
find a host body
- death -> spiderbot
- spiderbot that can gain control of other machines.
- creature that collects parts and builds onto itself
r2d2 brainslug
take over enemies?
find scrap to build onto oneself?
can zap doors, enemies
cannibalize small enemies to build needed body parts



# first anim sequence
**spiderbot is defunct, so this cinematic cannot be used**
Fade in to a dark room with lab equipment in the center.  There is a man leaning over a large capsule, and a device on a table nearby. The capsule is emitting light, but we cannot see inside.  The device on the table looks like a ball with tendrils, and is plugged in to the capsule.  The building shakes; chunks of the ceiling fall nearby.  The man looks up. "We have to get out of here". He unplugs the device and takes it under his arm and heads for the door.  Before he can reach the door the wall collapses on him. The device bounces on the floor and slides a short distance away.  It lies still for a moment before a light on the side emits a glow.

# Story Background (every science fiction trope?)
**A story like this may not be appropriate**
[The man] is a scientist that worked on the team that developed the first biotic, autonomous AI systems. Originally designed for head trauma patients, neurological-interfaces were coupled with machine learning to assist in recovery. Eventually the systems moved beyond analysis and treatment and became neural pathway augmentations. [[<- Ghost in the Shell]]

Before lawmakers could address ethical and legal concerns, the systems were being licensed commercially to militaries, research labs, and the wealthy.

Soldiers gained enhanced sensory perception and battlefield domination through unparalleled execution of drones. [accelerated healing, pain blockers, impulse control,...]

Researchers with improved cognition and eidetic memory raced to invent the singularity. The tradeoff of having supreme focus is having an ethical blindspot.
"I prefer to work with people that have a proclivity to be efficient and reliable."
"We're creating a better world. One that will fight us tooth-and-nail all the way to enlightenment."
"They meant well, but they lost their way. We have a plan to help them focus."

The wealthy proceed to consolidate power throughout the governments of the world, forming a global syndicate.  With a monopoly on fresh water and natural resources, the syndicate maintains control while preserving plausible deniability. The leading research labs are now funded by the syndicate.
"The masses cannot govern themselves. It is our prerogative to give them every opportunity to succeed. "
