FIX [use gen safe zone] generation does not destroy entities spawned at runtime. Should it? Showing off generation in a build is nice, but if it means implementing features never seen in the game, is it worth it?
FIX mushy on lift. consider the velocity of the object being collided-with. [CarryObject]
NOFIX: high offset off angled floor. This is a known cosmetic problem, addressed with the "multi_sample" code in UpdateCollision(), not in use.
FIX long slide clipping. collision should reduce velocity, not only position.
FIX minimum shoot vector, otherwise shots have no velocity (gamepad)
FIX control binding says "bad control index" for minimap (gamepad)
